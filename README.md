## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile methodologies operates under repetitive progress whivh involves small and manageble taks while Waterfall methodologies operates where the project requires linear and sequences approach at one phase and then the next phase starts.

Advantages of agile methodologies
- It is flexible because you can edit your project at any stage and make changes
- It identify's mistakes early
- It is efficient because you can deliver the project products in small stages
- It gives feedback faster
- It has a better visibility and accountability

Disadvantages of Agile methodologies
- It has less documentation adn this makes it hard to maintain and also to update
- It lacks predictavity baecause it has no plan when beginning
- It is complex and requires team members with higher experience

Advantages of Waterfall methodologies
- It is easy to understand because it follows a linear sequence and every team member is able to track the project status.
- It is easy to predict the outcomes because budget and timeline are determined at the beginning of the project
- The project phases are visible and clear to every team member
- It requires extensive documantations and this makes maintenance and updating easy

Disadvatages of Waterfall methodologies
- Risks to wastage of time due to transitions
- It doesn't involve client untill the end which can lead to dissatisfaction

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
